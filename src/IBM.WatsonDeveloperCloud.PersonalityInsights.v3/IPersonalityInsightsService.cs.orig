Derives personality insights for up to 20 MB of input content written by an author, though the service requires much less text to produce an accurate profile; for more information, see [Guidelines for providing sufficient input](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/personality-insights/input.html#sufficient). Accepts input in Arabic, English, Japanese, or Spanish and produces output in one of eleven languages. Provide plain text, HTML, or JSON content, and receive results in JSON or CSV format.

        /// <param name="contentType">The content type of the request: plain text (the default), HTML, or JSON. Per the JSON specification, the default character encoding for JSON content is effectively always UTF-8; per the HTTP specification, the default encoding for plain text and HTML is ISO-8859-1 (effectively, the ASCII character set). When specifying a content type of plain text or HTML, include the `charset` parameter to indicate the character encoding of the input text, for example, `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8`.</param>
        /// <param name="accept">The desired content type of the response: JSON (the default) or CSV. CSV output includes a fixed number of columns and optional headers.</param>
        /// <param name="body">A maximum of 20 MB of content to analyze, though the service requires much less text; for more information, see [Guidelines for providing sufficient input](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/personality-insights/input.html#sufficient). A JSON request must conform to the `ContentListContainer` model.</param>
        /// <param name="contentLanguage">The language of the input text for the request: Arabic, English, Spanish, or Japanese. Regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. The effect of the `Content-Language` header depends on the `Content-Type` header. When `Content-Type` is `text/plain` or `text/html`, `Content-Language` is the only way to specify the language. When `Content-Type` is `application/json`, `Content-Language` overrides a language specified with the `language` parameter of a `ContentItem` object, and content items that specify a different language are ignored; omit this header to base the language on the specification of the content items. You can specify any combination of languages for `Content-Language` and `Accept-Language`. (optional, default to en)</param>
